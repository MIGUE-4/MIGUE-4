# Hi Hi
## What's up? <br>
<div>
Welcome! I’m Miguel, a data analyst who is now looking to transition into a role as a data scientist or data engineer. I’ve really enjoyed working in the data field, but over time, being a data analyst can sometimes feel repetitive—especially with the need for constant client communication. Of course, you eventually master how to handle even the most difficult clients.

Now, I want to focus on improving my programming, logic, and other technical skills. To achieve this, I’ll be uploading many interesting projects here.
Needless to say, let's move on

      <div>I’m an AI superfan (especially when it comes to working on projects related to it). I love the world of data, particularly machine learning, neural networks, ETL, and more.
        
I’m also a student of statistics, and of course, I’ve grown to love it. Beyond AI and programming, I enjoy understanding how things work—how the world works, how we make decisions, how we find our purpose in life, and how we set our goals.

Yes, it’s a bit philosophical, but for me, it’s the most important part of life.</div>

### Anyway, I'm here to understand how AI, Machine Learning etc work, and here my attemp to delve in many projects. Well, here a piece of information about me, and my hobbies!:
<ul>
  <li>Books/Papers research</li>
  <li>I love reading manhwas (specially those are about Ethic, Moral or Sci-Fi)</li>
  <li>Programmming</li>
  <li>Basketball... except when my knees are having problems... :(</li>
</ul>
